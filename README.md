This repository contains a dataset with sentences from a wide range of genres with human formality assessments on a *continuous* formal-informal scale. Each sentence has a score between +1 (most formal) and -1 (most informal).

We provide the following files:

+ *in_formal_sentences.tsv*: the dataset
+ *in_formal_sentences.json*: the dataset with further information (e.g., reference, twitter id, or url)
+ *annotator_instructions.md*: the annotation guidelines in German
